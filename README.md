# React CRUD

## Post Lecture Challenge Review

### Part 1.
1. When the path is `/students/new`, we should see the form to create a new student
2. When the path is `/students/2`, we should see a student detail component that renders out an h2 of the student's first and last name for the second student
3. When the path is `/students/7`, we should see a student detail component that renders out an h2 of the student's first and last name for the seventh student

### Part 2.
1. Each student show component should have a button that says 'delete this student'
2. When we click it, we should delete that student from the database and then redirect them to '/students'
