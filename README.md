# Webpack, Babel, State, Events

### Goals for my Tools

1. I want to be able to write my code in separate files without having to explicitly list them in index.html
2. I want to be able to use syntax that a browser might not recognize
3. I'd like to be able to set this up so that the changes re-transpile automatically
